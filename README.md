# Shell Scripting Projects

## Description
This repository contains a collection of shell scripting projects covering various topics related to Linux shell scripting. Each project focuses on different aspects of shell scripting, ranging from basic navigation and file manipulation to permissions, I/O redirections, variables, expansions, and more.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Shell Basics
- Introduction to basic shell commands and concepts, such as `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, and `mv`.
- Navigating the file system, understanding the root and home directories, and handling hidden files.
- Using manual pages (`man`) and built-in help for commands.

### 2. Shell Permissions
- Understanding Linux file permissions (read, write, execute) and ownership structure (user, group, others).
- Manipulating permissions using commands like `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`, and understanding symbolic vs numeric modes.
- Executing commands with root privileges, and switching users with `su`.
- Creating and managing users and groups (`useradd`, `adduser`, `addgroup`).

### 3. Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters
- Exploring shell I/O redirections (`>`, `>>`, `<`) and filters (`|`) in Linux.
- Utilizing commands like `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `cut`, and `tr` for manipulating input and output streams.
- Understanding special characters (whitespace, quotes, escape characters) and their significance in shell scripting.

### 4. Shell, Init Files, Variables, and Expansions
- Delving into shell initialization files like `~/.bashrc`, `/etc/profile`, and environment variables.
- Understanding the difference between local and global variables, and reserved variables like `PATH`, `HOME`, and `PS1`.
- Learning about shell arithmetic operations, aliases, command substitutions (`$(command)`), and expansions.
- Performing arithmetic operations in the shell and managing floating-point numbers.

## Learning Objectives
Each project comes with specific learning objectives tailored to help you understand and master different aspects of shell scripting. By completing these projects, you'll gain practical experience and knowledge essential for working with shell scripts in Linux environments.

---

## Requirements
- All scripts are tested on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.
- Scripts should be exactly **two lines long** (`$ wc -l file` should print 2).
- All files should end with a **new line** and start with `#!/bin/bash`.
- Avoid using `&&`, `||`, or command separators (`;`).
